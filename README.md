## Forms & Routing

The GrihaSeva project implements several forms for users and service providers. These forms handle tasks such as registration and login. Each form is connected to a Python-Flask backend for server-side validation and processing. Below are some of the main forms and their routing paths:

#### 1. **User Registration Form**
  - **Route**: `/user-register`
  - **Method**: `POST`
  - **Functionality**: Allows new users to create an account by submitting personal details such as:
    - Full Name
    - Email Address
    - Password
    - Phone Number
  - **Backend Process**:
    - Validates user input (e.g., email format, password length).
    - Checks if the email already exists in the database.
    - Stores the user's data directly into the database without hashing (ensure password security is handled properly in future updates).
    - Redirects users to the login page upon successful registration.
  - **Security Considerations**:
    - Though passwords are stored as plain text for now (NOT recommended for production environments), future iterations should implement password hashing for better security.
    - Input fields are validated to prevent SQL injection or XSS attacks.
    - Email confirmation can be added to further validate users.

#### 2. **User Login Form**
  - **Route**: `/user-login`
  - **Method**: `POST`
  - **Functionality**: Allows registered users to log in by providing:
    - Email Address
    - Password
  - **Backend Process**:
    - Validates the email and password.
    - Matches the entered email and password against the stored values in the database.
    - Creates a user session upon successful authentication.
    - Redirects the user to the service dashboard after successful login.
    - Provides an error message if the credentials are incorrect.
  - **Security Considerations**:
    - Since passwords are stored in plain text, this should be considered for improvement by adding password hashing in future updates.
    - Uses sessions to maintain user authentication.
    - Implements brute-force protection by limiting the number of login attempts.

#### 3. **Provider Login Form**
  - **Route**: `/provider-login`
  - **Method**: `POST`
  - **Functionality**: Allows service providers to log in and manage their service offerings by submitting:
    - Provider ID
    - Password
  - **Backend Process**:
    - Authenticates service providers based on their unique ID and password.
    - Grants access to a dashboard where they can manage service requests, view user feedback, and update availability.
  - **Security Considerations**:
    - Provider credentials are checked against plain text data (consider adding password encryption in future versions).
    - Sessions are used to authenticate providers during their logged-in period.

### Documentation Validation

To ensure the quality, accuracy, and reliability of our documentation, we have implemented the following validation methods:

- **Peer Review**:  
  The documentation has been reviewed by multiple team members and developers who provided feedback on its clarity, completeness, and adherence to best practices. All suggestions and corrections have been incorporated into the final version.

- **User Testing**:  
  We conducted testing with users unfamiliar with the project. These users followed the documentation step-by-step to set up, install, and navigate the system. Feedback from this testing process was used to improve clarity and ensure that the instructions are easy to follow.

- **Functional Testing**:  
  Every step in the documentation has been executed exactly as described. This includes:
  - Setting up the environment.
  - Installing required dependencies.
  - Running the project locally.
  - Testing the forms and routing to ensure they function as expected.
  
  This ensures that the provided instructions lead to a successful setup and that the project behaves as intended when following the documentation.

By following these validation processes, we strive to provide a reliable, clear, and user-friendly guide for anyone interacting with the GrihaSeva project.
